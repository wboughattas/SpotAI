-----

## Installation

2 choices are offered to user:

- SpotAI has access to the small dataset (few MBs); the sql sump script is provided: **init.sql**
- SpotAI has access to the large dataset (35GBs); download the open-sourced data sql dump
  from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5002584#.Y8xpni_73Bs), and run the following commands to populate the database
  (this requires spotify dev id and token) and takes few hours:

  ```bash
  python run_forever.py get_songs_features.py
  ```

  and

  ```bash
  python run_forever.py get_albums_release_dates.py
  ```

  > Use the 35Gbs database for dev only
